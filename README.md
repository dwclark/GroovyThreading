GroovyThreading
===============

Presentation and sample code dealing with groovy threading and gpars

Covers:

0) Basic java threading concepts (such as memory model, final, volatie, synchronized)
1) Immutability and programming with values
2) Thread interruption
3) Locks
4) Concurrent collections/parallel arrays
5) Actors
6) Dataflow concurrency

Possibly Cover:

1) History of java threading improvements
2) The threading approaches advantages/disadvantages of the three main new JVM languages: Clojure, Scala, and Groovy.  Note to JRuby fans, I ommit JRuby mainly because I see it as more participating in the Ruby universe, rather than the JVM universe, that it runs on the JVM is mainly an implementation detail.
3) The need for threading in modern JVM applications
